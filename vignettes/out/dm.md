## Introduction

In this article we’re going show you how easy it is to move from
connecting to the database holding your data to producing the results
you need. It’s meant to be a quick and friendly introduction to {dm}, so
it is low on details and caveats. Links to detailed documentation are
provided at the end. (If your data is in data frames instead of a
database and you’re in a hurry, jump over to `vignette("howto-dm-df")`.)

## Creating a dm object

dm objects can be created from individual tables or loaded directly from
a relational data model on an RDBMS (relational database management
system).

For this demonstration we’re going work with a model hosted on a public
server. The first thing we need is a connection to the RDBMS hosting the
data.

``` r
library(RMariaDB)

fin_db <- dbConnect(
  MariaDB(),
  username = 'guest',
  password = 'relational',
  dbname = 'Financial_ijs',
  host = 'relational.fit.cvut.cz'
)
#> Error: Failed to connect: Lost connection to MySQL server at 'waiting for initial communication packet', system error: 110
```

We create a dm object from an RDBMS using `dm_from_src()`, passing in
the connection object we just created as the first argument.

``` r
library(dm)

fin_dm <- dm_from_src(fin_db)
#> Error in dm_from_src(fin_db): object 'fin_db' not found
fin_dm
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fin_dm' not found
```

The dm object interrogates the RDBMS for table and column information
and, where implemented, primary and foreign keys. Currently, primary and
foreign keys are only available from Postgres and SQL Server.

## Selecting tables

The dm object can be accessed like a named list of tables:

``` r
names(fin_dm)
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fin_dm' not found
fin_dm$loans
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fin_dm' not found
dplyr::count(fin_dm$trans)
#> Error in dplyr::count(fin_dm$trans): object 'fin_dm' not found
```

At the same time, most `dm` functions are pipe-friendly and support tidy
evaluation. We can use `[` or the `dm_select_tbl()` verb to derive a
smaller dm with the `loans`, `accounts`, `districts` and `trans` tables:

``` r
fin_dm_small <- fin_dm[c("loans", "accounts", "districts", "trans")]
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fin_dm' not found
fin_dm_small <-
  fin_dm %>%
  dm_select_tbl(loans, accounts, districts, trans)
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm' not found
```

## Linking tables by adding keys

In many cases, `dm_from_src()` already returns a dm with all keys set.
If not, dm allows us to define primary and foreign keys ourselves.

In our data model, `id` columns uniquely identify records in the
`accounts` and `loans` table, a primary key is added with `dm_add_pk()`.
Each loan is linked to one account via the `account_id` column in the
`loans` table, the relationship is established with `dm_add_fk()`.

``` r
fin_dm_keys <-
  fin_dm_small %>%
  dm_add_pk(accounts, id) %>%
  dm_add_pk(loans, id) %>%
  dm_add_fk(loans, account_id, accounts) %>%
  dm_add_pk(trans, id) %>%
  dm_add_fk(trans, account_id, accounts) %>%
  dm_add_pk(districts, id) %>%
  dm_add_fk(accounts, district_id, districts)
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm_small' not found
```

## Visualizing a data model

Having a diagram of the data model is the quickest way to verify we’re
on the right track. We can display a visual summary of the dm at any
time. The default is to display the table name, any defined keys and
their links to other tables.

Visualizing the dm in its current state we see the keys we have created
and how they link the tables together. Color guides the eye.

``` r
fin_dm_keys %>%
  dm_set_colors(green = c(loans, accounts), darkblue = trans, grey = districts) %>%
  dm_draw()
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm_keys' not found
```

## Accessing a data model as a table

If we want to perform modeling or analysis on this relational model we
need to transform it into a tabular format that R functions can work
with. `dm_squash_to_tbl()` will automatically follow foreign keys across
tables to gather all the available columns into a single table.

``` r
fin_dm_keys %>%
  dm_squash_to_tbl(loans)
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm_keys' not found
```

Apart from the rows printed above, no data has been fetched from the
database. Use `select()` to reduce the number of columns fetched, and
`collect()` to retrieve the entire result for local processing.

``` r
loans_df <-
  fin_dm_keys %>%
  dm_squash_to_tbl(loans) %>%
  select(id, amount, duration, A3) %>%
  collect()
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm_keys' not found

model <- lm(amount ~ duration + A3, data = loans_df)
#> Error in is.data.frame(data): object 'loans_df' not found

model
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'model' not found
```

## Operations on table data within a dm

We don’t need to take the extra step of exporting the data to work with
it. Through the dm object we have complete access to dplyr’s data
manipulation verbs. These operate on the data within individual tables.

To work with a particular table we use `dm_zoom_to()` to set the context
to our chosen table. Then we can perform any of the operations we want.

``` r
fin_dm_total <-
  fin_dm_keys %>%
  dm_zoom_to(loans) %>%
  group_by(account_id) %>%
  summarize(total_amount = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dm_insert_zoomed("total_loans")
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm_keys' not found

fin_dm_total$total_loans
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fin_dm_total' not found
```

Note that in the above example we use `dm_insert_zoomed()` to add the
results as a new table to our data model. This table is temporary and
will be deleted when our session ends. If you want to make permanent
changes to your data model on an RDBMS please see the “Persisting
results” section in `vignette("howto-dm-db")`.

## Checking constraints

It’s always smart to check that your data model follows its
specifications. When building our own model or changing existing models
by adding tables or keys, it is even more important that the new model
is validated.

`dm_examine_constrains()` checks all primary and foreign keys and
reports if they violate their expected constraints.

``` r
fin_dm_total %>%
  dm_examine_constraints()
#> Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'fin_dm_total' not found
```

For more on constraint checking, including cardinality, finding
candidate columns for keys, and normalization, see

## Next Steps

Now that you have been introduced to the basic operation of dm, the next
step is to learn more about the dm methods that your particular use case
requires.

Is your data in an RDBMS? Then move on to `vignette("howto-dm-db")` for
a more detailed looking at working with an existing relational data
model.

If your data is in data frames, then you want to read
`vignette("howto-dm-df")` next.

If you feel you need to know more about relational data models in order
to get the most out of dm, check out `vignette("howto-dm-theory")`.

If you’re familiar with relational data models but want to know how to
work with them in dm, then any of `vignette("tech-dm-join")`,
`vignette("tech-dm-filter")`, or `vignette("tech-dm-zoom")` is a good
next step.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

The {dm} package follows the tidyverse principles:

  - `dm` objects are immutable (your data will never be overwritten in
    place)
  - most functions used on `dm` objects are pipeable (i.e., return new
    `dm` or table objects)
  - tidy evaluation is used (unquoted function parameters are supported)

The {dm} package builds heavily upon the [{datamodelr}
package](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr), and upon the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). We’re looking forward to a good
collaboration\!

The [{polyply} package](https://github.com/russHyde/polyply) has a
similar intent with a slightly different interface.

The [{data.cube} package](https://github.com/jangorecki/data.cube) has
quite the same intent using `array`-like interface.

Articles in the [{rquery} package](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery)
discuss [join
controllers](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/JoinController.md)
and [join dependency
sorting](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/DependencySorting.md),
with the intent to move the declaration of table relationships from code
to data.

The [{tidygraph} package](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) stores
a network as two related tables of `nodes` and `edges`, compatible with
{dplyr} workflows.

In object-oriented programming languages, [object-relational
mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) is a
similar concept that attempts to map a set of related tables to a class
hierarchy.

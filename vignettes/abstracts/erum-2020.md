Storing all data related to a problem in a single table or data frame ("the dataset") can result in many repetitive values. Separation into multiple tables helps data quality but requires "merge" or "join" operations. {dm} is a new package that fills a gap in the R ecosystem: it makes working with multiple tables just as easy as working with a single table.

A "data model" consists of tables (both the definition and the data), and primary and foreign keys. The {dm} package combines these concepts with data manipulation powered by the tidyverse: entire data models are handled in a single entity, a "dm" object.

Three principal use cases can be identified:

1. Consumer of a data model access and manipulate a dataset consisting of multiple tables (database or local data frames) through a consistent interface. Operations on dm objects allow manipulation of the tables and the definition of derived tables.

2. When using a third-party dataset, it pays off to remove redundancies by normalizing the data as part of the cleaning process. The {dm} package helps maintaining keys and relationships without having to rely on an external database.

3. Creator of relational data models can prepare the data using R and familiar tools. The data model can be checked for referential integrity before being copied to a database, where it can be consumed e.g. by Power BI.

The presentation revolves around these use cases and shows a few applications. The {dm} package is available on GitHub and will be submitted to CRAN in early February.

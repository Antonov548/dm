Multiple, linked tables are a common concept within computer science. 
Since many R users have a background in other disciplines, we present **five important terms in relational data modeling** to jump-start working with {dm}.

It's good to have at least basic knowledge about the following five terms:

1) [Model](#model)
2) [Primary Keys](#pk)
3) [Foreign Keys](#fk)
4) [Normalisation](#normalisation)
5) [Relational Databases](#relational-databases)

## 1. Model {#model}

A data model shows the structure between multiple tables, that can be linked together.

An example is the [`nycflights13` dataset](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13).
It contains detailed information of 336776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013.
The information is stored in five tables.

The `nycflights13` relations can be transferred into the following graphical representation:

The `flights` table is linked to three other tables: `airlines`, `planes` and `airports`.
By using directed arrows the visualization explicitly shows the connection between different columns (they are called attributes in the relational data sphere).

For example: The column `carrier` in `flights` can be joined with the column `carrier` from the `airlines` table.

The links between the tables are established through [primary keys](#pk) and [foreign keys](#fk).

## 2. Primary Keys {#pk}

In a relational data model every table needs to have **one column or attribute that uniquely identifies a row**.
This column is called primary key (abbreviated with pk).
A primary key can be either an existing column that satifies the condition of being unique or a new column that assigns an identifier.

Example: In the `airlines` table of `nycflights13` the column `carrier` is the primary key.

Further Reading:The {dm} package offers several function for dealing with [primary keys](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm-class-and-basic-operations.html#pk).

## 3. Foreign Keys {#fk}

The **counterpart of a primary key in one table is the foreign key in another table**.
In order to join two tables, the primary key of the first table needs to be available in the second table, too.
This second column is called the foreign key (abbreviated with fk).

For example: If you want to link the `airlines` table to the `flights` table, the primary key in `airlines` needs to match the foreign key in `flights`.
This is true, because the column `carrier` is present as a primary key in the `airlines` table as well as a foreign key in the `flights` table.

Further Reading: The {dm} functions for working with [foreign keys](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm-class-and-basic-operations.html#foreign-keys).


## 4. Normalisation {#normalisation}

Normalisation is the technical term that describes the **central design principle of a relational data model**:
splitting data into multiple tables.

A normalized data schema consists of several relations (tables) that are linked with attributes (columns).
The joining is with [primary](#pk) and [foreign keys](#fk).
One main goal is to keep the data organization as clean and simple as possible by avoiding redundant data entries.

For example: If you want to change the name of one airport in the `nycflights13` dataset, you have to update just a single data entry.
Sometimes, this principle is called "single point of truth".

Further Reading: See the [Simple English Wikipedia article on database normalisation](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalisation) for more details.

## 5. Relational Databases {#relational-databases}

{dm} is built upon relational data models, but it is not a database itself.
Databases are systems for data management and many of them are constructed as relational databases, e.g. SQLite, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres.
As you can guess from the names of the databases SQL, short for **s**tructured **q**uerying **l**anguage, plays an important role: It was invented for the purpose of querying relational databases.

In production, the data is stored in a relational database and {dm} is used to work with the data.

Therefore, {dm} can copy data [from and to databases](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm.html#copy).

An object of the `dm`-class contains all relevant information about the tables in a data model:

1. the place where the tables live (i.e., the `src`: a database (DB) or locally in your R session)
2. the tables themselves, i.e., the data
3. the meta-data from the data model: the key relations

The functions of {dm} are designed to work both locally and on DBs.

\usage{
check_cardinality_0_n(parent_table, pk_column, child_table, fk_column)

check_cardinality_1_n(parent_table, pk_column, child_table, fk_column)

check_cardinality_1_1(parent_table, pk_column, child_table, fk_column)

check_cardinality_0_1(parent_table, pk_column, child_table, fk_column)

examine_cardinality(parent_table, pk_column, child_table, fk_column)
}
\arguments{
\item{parent_table}{Data frame.}

\item{pk_column}{Columns of \code{parent_table} that have to be one of its unique keys, for multiple columns use \code{c(col1, col2)}.}

\item{child_table}{Data frame.}

\item{fk_column}{Columns of \code{child_table} that have to be a foreign key candidate to \code{pk_column} in \code{parent_table}, for multiple columns use \code{c(col1, col2)}.}
}
\value{
For \verb{check_cardinality_?_?()}: Functions return \code{parent_table}, invisibly, if the check is passed, to support pipes.
Otherwise an error is thrown and the reason for it is explained.

For \code{examine_cardinality()}: Returns a character variable specifying the type of relationship between the two columns.
}
\description{
All \verb{check_cardinality_?_?()} functions test the following conditions:
\enumerate{
\item Is \code{pk_column} a unique key for \code{parent_table}?
\item Is the set of values in \code{fk_column} of \code{child_table} a subset of the set of values of \code{pk_column}?
\item Does the relation between the two tables of the data model meet the cardinality requirements?
}

\code{examine_cardinality()} also checks the first two points and subsequently determines the type of cardinality.
}
\details{
All cardinality-functions accept a \verb{parent table} (data frame), column names of this table,
a \verb{child table}, and column names of the child table.
The given columns of the \verb{parent table} have to be one of its
unique keys (no duplicates are allowed).
Furthermore, in all cases, the set of combinations of the child table's columns have
to be a subset of the combinations of values of the parent table's columns.

The cardinality specifications \verb{0_n}, \verb{1_n}, \verb{0_1}, \verb{1_1} refer to the expected relation that the child table has with the parent table.
The numbers \code{0}, \code{1} and \code{n} refer to the number of occurrences of combinations
of values of the columns of the child table that correspond to each combination in the
columns of the parent table.
\code{n} means "more than one" in this context, with no upper limit.

\verb{0_n} means, that each combination of \code{pk_column} values has at least \code{0} and at most
\code{n} corresponding occurrences in the columns of the child table
(which translates to no further restrictions).

\verb{1_n} means, that each combination of \code{pk_column} values has at least \code{1} and at most
\code{n} corresponding occurrences in the columns of the child table.
This means that there is a "surjective" mapping from the child table
to the parent table w.r.t. the specified columns, i.e. each combination in the
parent table columns exists at least once in the child table columns.

\verb{0_1} means, that each combination of \code{pk_column} values has at least \code{0} and at most
\code{1} corresponding occurrence in the column of the child table.
This means that there is a "injective" mapping from the child table
to the parent table w.r.t. the specified columns, i.e. no combination of values in the
parent table columns is addressed multiple times.
But not all of the parent table column values have to be referred to.

\verb{1_1} means, that each combination of \code{pk_column} values has exactly
\code{1}  corresponding occurrence in the columns of the child table.
This means that there is a "bijective" ("injective" AND "surjective") mapping
between the child table and the parent table w.r.t. the specified columns, i.e. the
respective sets of combinations within the two sets of columns are equal and there
are no duplicates in either of them.

Finally, \code{examine_cardinality()} tests for and returns the nature of the relationship (injective, surjective, bijective, or none of these)
between the two given sets of columns. If either \code{pk_column} is not a unique key of \code{parent_table} or the values of \code{fk_column} are
not a subset of the values in \code{pk_column}, the requirements for a cardinality test is not fulfilled. No error will be thrown, but
the result will contain the information which prerequisite was violated.

\examples{
d1 <- tibble::tibble(a = 1:5)
d2 <- tibble::tibble(c = c(1:5, 5))
d3 <- tibble::tibble(c = 1:4)
# This does not pass, `c` is not unique key of d2:
try(check_cardinality_0_n(d2, c, d1, a))

# This passes, multiple values in d2$c are allowed:
check_cardinality_0_n(d1, a, d2, c)

# This does not pass, injectivity is violated:
try(check_cardinality_1_1(d1, a, d2, c))

# This passes:
check_cardinality_0_1(d1, a, d3, c)

# Returns the kind of cardinality
examine_cardinality(d1, a, d2, c)

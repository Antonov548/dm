\title{Retrieve the names of the columns marked as a foreign key, pointing from one table of a \code{\link{dm}} to another table.}
\usage{
dm_get_fk(dm, table, ref_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{A \code{dm} object.}

\item{table}{A table in the \code{dm}.}

\item{ref_table}{The table that is referenced from \code{table}.}
}
\value{
A character vector with the column name(s) of \code{table}, pointing to the primary key of \code{ref_table}.
}
\description{
\code{dm_get_fk()} returns the names of the
columns marked as foreign key of table \code{table} with respect to table \code{ref_table} within a \code{\link{dm}} object.
If no foreign key is set between the tables, an empty character vector is returned.
}
\section{Compound keys}{


Currently, keys consisting of more than one column are not supported.
\href{https://github.com/krlmlr/dm/issues/3}{This feature} is planned for dm 0.2.0.
This means that after this change the character vector returned by \code{dm_get_fk()} can be of length > 1.

# dm

## Overview

dm is an R package for building and manipulating relational databases to aid the querying of data models stored in local dataframes, and the construction of flat data models from relational databases.

The intent behind dm is to bridge the gap in the data pipeline between individual dataframes and relational databases by providing methods to move data between different sources, and methods for performing data manipulation (eg, aggregation, summarisation, filtering, etc) and table manipulation (eg, joins, creation, deletion, etc) that are agnostic to the data source.

Calling methods on a dm object for importing data sources, defining relationships between them, and specifying the sequence of operations to produce the required data, results in clearly specified and repeatable workflows. 
dm's use of lazy evaluation minimises transfer and duplication of large datasets as you build your workflow, while providing snapshots of intermediate results for confirming your workflow is producing the expected results.

dm builds upon the [DBI](https://github.com/r-dbi/DBI) package for interfacing with over 30 DBMS's, [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for its database interaction methods and its grammar of data manipulation, and [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for its column operations. 

If you are new to dm, the best place to begin is the [Getting Started article](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm.html).

## Installation

The latest stable version of the {dm} package can be obtained from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dm) with the command

```r
install.packages("dm")
```

The latest development version of {dm} can be installed from GitHub.

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krlmlr/dm")
```

## Usage
#FIXME - is this feasible for a library with all the features of dm?
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(dm)

flights_dm <- dm_from_src(src_df(pkg = "nycflights13"))
#...etc
``` 
## Getting help

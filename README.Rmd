# dm

The goal of {dm} is to provide tools for reoccurring tasks when working with a set of related tables.
The `dm` class stores properties of a set of related tables in a compound object:

- a `src`: location of tables (database, in-memory, ...)
- a `data_model`: metadata about data model (keys, table & columns names, ...)
- the data: the tables itself

This concept augments {dplyr}/{dbplyr} workflows:

- multiple related tables are kept in a single object,
- joins across multiple tables are available by stating the tables involved, no need to memoize column names or relationships
- works with all data sources that provide a {dplyr} interface: local data frames, relational databases, and more.

In addition, a battery of utilities is provided that helps with creating a tidy data model.

## Example

A readymade `dm` object with preset keys is included in the package:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dm)

cdm_nycflights13()
```

The `cdm_draw()` function creates a visualization of the entity relationship model:

```{r draw}
cdm_nycflights13() %>% 
  cdm_draw()
```

### Filtering and joining {#filter}

Similarly to `dplyr::filter()`, a filtering function `cdm_filter()` is available for `dm` objects.
You need to provide the `dm` object, the table whose rows you want to filter, and the filter expression.
A `dm` object is returned whose tables only contain rows that are related to the reduced rows in the filtered table.
This currently only works for cycle-free relationships between the tables.

```{r}
cdm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  cdm_get_tables() %>%
  map_int(nrow)

cdm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>% 
  cdm_filter(planes, year == 2000, manufacturer == "BOEING") %>%
  cdm_get_tables() %>%
  map_int(nrow)
```

For joining two tables using their relationship defined in the `dm`, you can use `cdm_join_tbl()`:

```{r}
cdm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  cdm_join_tbl(airports, flights, join = semi_join)
```

In our `dm`, the `origin` column of the `flights` table points to the `airports` table.
Since all `nycflights13`-flights depart from New York, only these airports are included in the semi-join.

### From and to databases

In order to transfer an existing `dm` object to a DB, you can call `cdm_copy_to()` with the target DB and the `dm` object:

```{r}
src_sqlite <- src_sqlite(":memory:", create = TRUE)
src_sqlite
nycflights13_remote <- cdm_copy_to(src_sqlite, cdm_nycflights13())
nycflights13_remote
```

The key constraints from the original object are also copied to the newly created object.
With the default setting `set_key_constraints = TRUE` for `cdm_copy_to()`, key constraints are also established on the target DB.
Currently this feature is only supported for MSSQL and Postgres database management systems (DBMS).

It is also possible to automatically create a `dm` object from the permanent tables of a DB.
Again, for now just MSSQL and Postgres are supported for this feature, so the next chunk is not evaluated.
The support for other DBMS will be implemented in a future update.

```{r eval=FALSE}
src_postgres <- src_postgres()
nycflights13_from_remote <- cdm_learn_from_db(src_postgres)
```

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This package follows the tidyverse principles:

- `dm` objects are immutable (your data will never be overwritten in place)
- many functions used on `dm` objects are pipeable (i.e., return new `dm` objects)
- tidy evaluation is used (unquoted function parameters are supported)

The {dm} package builds heavily upon the [{datamodelr} package](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr), and upon the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
We're looking forward to a good collaboration!

The [{polyply} package](https://github.com/russHyde/polyply) has a similar intent with a slightly different interface.

Articles in the [{rquery} package](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) discuss [join controllers](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/JoinController.md) and [join dependency sorting](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/DependencySorting.md), with the intent to move the declaration of table relationships from code to data.

## Installation

Once on CRAN, the package can be installed with

```r
install.packages("dm")
```

Install the latest development version with

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krlmlr/dm")
```
